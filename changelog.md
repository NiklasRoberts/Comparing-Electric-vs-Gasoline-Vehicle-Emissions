Initial version: released November 2022

V2: released March 2023:
- Initial version was built on the faulty implicit assumption that ICE automobiles and EVs utilize energy at the same rate by comparing emissions per kWh.
- To account for the fact that the energy generated is harnessed in different ways, Electric Vehicles and Gasoline Vehicles are now compared with emissions per mile driven
- Calculations, results data, and documentation have all been updated to reflect this change.
